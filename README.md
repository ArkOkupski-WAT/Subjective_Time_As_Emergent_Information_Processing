# Subjective Time as Emergent Information Processing

## Key Features
- Explains time dilation effects under stress/meditation  
- Predicts cross-species time perception differences  
- Connects neuroscience with information physics  

Mathematical model proposing that subjective time perception (τ) emerges from information density (I/V) in conscious systems, described by:

```math
τ = \frac{K}{V} \ln\left(1 + \frac{I}{I_0}\right)
