# Analysis of the Originality of the Hypothesis 

The following document summarizes the originality assessment of the proposed mathematical model of subjective time perception:

## Key Elements of the Hypothesis

The hypothesis proposes that subjective time ($\tau$) emerges from information density ($I$) in conscious systems, formalized as:

$$
\tau = \frac{K}{V} \ln\left(1 + \frac{I}{I_0}\right)
$$

where:
- $K$ is a proportionality constant
- $V$ represents information processing speed
- $I_0$ is a reference information threshold

## Originality Assessment

### Similarities to Existing Work
- The logarithmic relationship between stimulus intensity and perception aligns with the Weber-Fechner law [1]
- The connection between information density and time perception appears in Eagleman's (2008) work on surprising events [2]
- Information integration approaches resemble Tononi's Integrated Information Theory [3]

### Novel Aspects
- The specific combination of parameters ($\frac{K}{V}$ multiplier with logarithmic transform) appears unique in time perception models
- The explicit inclusion of a processing speed term ($V$) provides a new neurocomputational perspective
- The reference threshold ($I_0$) offers a novel way to model individual differences in temporal perception

### Conclusion
While individual components have precedents in literature, the particular formulation and its application to emergent information processing in conscious systems appears to be original. The model provides a new mathematical framework for investigating subjective time perception.
