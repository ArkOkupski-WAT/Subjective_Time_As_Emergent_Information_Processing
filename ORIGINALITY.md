# Analysis of the Originality of the Hypothesis 

The following document summarizes the originality assessment of the proposed mathematical model of subjective time perception:

## Key Elements of the Hypothesis

The hypothesis proposes that subjective time ($\tau$) emerges from information density ($I$) in conscious systems, formalized as:

\[
\tau = \frac{K}{V} \ln\left(1 + \frac{I}{I_0}\right)
\]

where:
- $K$ is a proportionality constant,
- $V$ represents information processing speed,
- $I_0$ is a reference information threshold.

## Originality Assessment

### Similarities to Existing Work
\begin{itemize}
\item The logarithmic relationship between stimulus intensity and perception aligns with the Weber-Fechner law \cite{fechner1860}.
\item The connection between information density and time perception appears in Eagleman's (2008) work on surprising events \cite{eagleman2008}.
\item Information integration approaches resemble Tononi's Integrated Information Theory \cite{tononi2008}.
\end{itemize}

### Novel Aspects
\begin{itemize}
\item The specific combination of parameters ($\frac{K}{V}$ multiplier with logarithmic transform) appears unique in time perception models.
\item The explicit inclusion of a processing speed term ($V$) provides a new neurocomputational perspective.
\item The reference threshold ($I_0$) offers a novel way to model individual differences in temporal perception.
\end{itemize}

### Conclusion
While individual components have precedents in literature, the particular formulation and its application to emergent information processing in conscious systems appears to be original. The model provides a new mathematical framework for investigating subjective time perception.
